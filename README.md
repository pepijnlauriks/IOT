## Introduction

In this manual I'm going to show you how to make a (very rudimentary) Tsunami early warning system. It uses a vibration sensor that has a spring when the spring shakes it outputs a value that we can use to control an LED strip  All the code is written on MacOS and with the Arduino IDE program. 
You can download the Arduino IDE here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

## Components:
For this manual you'll need the following components:

  - NodeMCU V3
  - KY-002 vibration sensor
  - 6 female to female wires
  - Neopixel Ledstrip ws2812b
  - Micro usb cable

## Step 1 Connecting the hardware

Connect the hardware components by following this diagram


## Step 2 Testing the sensor
If everything is wired up we can try getting a value from our sensor.

## Step 3 Testing the ledstrip

## Step 4 Coding the system
### 4.1 Reading the sensor
### 4.2 IF-statements
### 4.3 Output

## Step 5 Testing the system

## Step 6 Done
